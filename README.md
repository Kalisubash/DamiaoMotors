# DamiaoMotors
This project demonstrates how to control a Damiao (DM) brushless servo motor—specifically the DM6006 or any supported DM series motor—using Python over a CAN bus interface. The code uses the DM_CAN_Library to communicate with the motor via a USB-to-CAN adapter connected to a Raspberry Pi
